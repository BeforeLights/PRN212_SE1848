# PRN212 Course Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal repository for the PRN212 class! This space is where I keep track of all the materials, notes, code examples, exercises, and projects from my studies. It serves as a personal log of my learning journey and a reference for the concepts covered.

## üìö About This Repository

This repository contains a collection of my work and learning materials from the PRN212 course. PRN212 courses often focus on programming principles, commonly using languages like C# with the .NET framework, covering Object-Oriented Programming, and potentially foundational application development.

**Inside, you might find materials related to:**
* Fundamentals of Programming (e.g., variables, control structures, methods)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts (e.g., classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)
* Layered Architecture Design (e.g., Business Objects, Data Access Layer, Repositories, Services)
* Repository Pattern
* Dependency Injection principles (implied by the use of interfaces and concrete classes)
* C# 13.0 and .NET 9 features as they are explored.
* Data access technologies (e.g., LINQ to SQL, LINQ to Objects).
* Design Patterns (e.g., Builder, Factory)
* Delegates and other C# specific features.
